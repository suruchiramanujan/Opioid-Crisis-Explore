# Opioid Trends Across the United States

The Shiny App can be found
[HERE](https://sramanujan.shinyapps.io/final-project-opioid/).

The rest of this repo contains the raw data both in csv and rds format.

The all_data file contains the code for converting the cleaned csv files
into rds format. 

The Opioid_Crisis_Code.Rmd contains all of the code used to create the plots.

Meanwhile, Opioid_Crisis_App.R converts the code into a usable format for the 
Shiny App.
